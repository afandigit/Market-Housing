# Market Housing Project

------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview :

I am using the Scrapy Framework to scrape datasets from websites offering real estate listings for sales and rentals. The goal is to analyze this data and develop a Machine Learning model that suggests listings to clients based on their preferences and financial capabilities.

This involves extracting relevant features from the listings, such as location, price, property type, and amenities, and using these features to train a recommendation system.

The system will leverage data analysis, data science techniques, and business intelligence to provide personalized and financially feasible real estate options for clients.

This project aims to enhance the user experience and optimize the property search process, ultimately driving better business outcomes for real estate platforms.
